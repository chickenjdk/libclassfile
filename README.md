# libclassfile

Parse class files with ease. Nearly completely up to the specs at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se22/html/jvms-4.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se22/html/jvms-4.html) and strongly typed.

# Use

Call export
function readClassFile(buffer: readableBuffer)
Returnes a structure with similar names to the docs but you can check the types.
